Quick Version:

	$ tar xjvf ocaml-freetds-<version>.tar.bz2
	$ cd ocaml-freetds-<version>
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	# make install

Long Version:

1)	'./configure'
	'./configure --help' will indicate parameters to
	compilation that you might want to set.

2)	'make'
	This will build ocaml-freetds according to your ./configure instructions.

3)	'make install'
	Run this as root, or someone with permissions to the findlib's destdir.
	This should install ocaml-freetds as a findlib package, so you can use
	'ocamlfind' to build things with it.

Other things to build:

*	You can also build a toplevel with "make freetds.top"
